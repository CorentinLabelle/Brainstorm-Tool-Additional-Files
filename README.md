# Brainstorm-Tool-Additional-Files
This repository contains datasets and files to test the tool and the documentation to manually build a pipeline.

## Testing
To test the tool, execute the pipeline on the correspondong dataset and compare the output report to the report of the expected output.
| Dataset | Pipeline | Expected Output |
| -------- | ------- | ------- |
| Face13_S01_S02* | [test pipeline](./pipeline/example/pipeline_eeg_test.json) | [Face13_S01_S02_output](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1LcvRIQI5sKkngBscJkX3_QP5qVxDjfo5/view?usp=drive_link) |
| [Face13 dataset](https://github.com/BUCANL/Face13) | Pipeline | Face13_output |

\* The Face13_S01_S02 dataset contains only the subject 1 and subject 2 of the [Face13 dataset](https://github.com/BUCANL/Face13).


## How to build a pipeline
[Here](./pipeline) is the documentation to manually build a pipeline.
