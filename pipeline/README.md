# How To a Create Pipeline

An [example of a pipeline](./example/pipeline_eeg_test.json) can be used as a starting point (before adding or removing processes). A [list of process](./process_documentation.md) and a [template for each process](./process_json_templates.md) is avaible on this repo.

Pipelines are saved as `JSON`. The only required field is `Processes`, which contains a list of processes that will be executed one after the other.
